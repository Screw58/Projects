# Projects

## General info

 Linefollower is my first project based on STM32 microcontroller. The program is written in C language with the HAL library, 
but it was written by me and not generated by CUBE_MX. GPIO initialization was written using registers (gpio.h and gpio.c files).
I designed the PCB in the Altium Designer program, and made using the thermal transfer method. 
The structural parts were designed in Fusion 360 and printed on my 3D printer

## Programs

Project is created with:
* Altium Designer 22
* STM32CubeIDE 1.9.0
* Autodesk Fusion 360
